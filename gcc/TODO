Add a little printout before processing the file to let the user know which channels are being processed. More than once I have processed a file only to realize that it included, say, three PCM channels instead of the single channel that I wanted. It totally screws up parsing the PCM stream, of course.
Also, note that right now, we do not conform to CH10 standards. If you want the output to be correct and to get the SFID words in the binary dump, you actually need to set the number of words in a minor frame to separately include each sync word. For example, if your sync word is 30 bits long and consists of 3 separate, 10-bit words, you don't consider the sync word as a single word--consider it as 3 separate words in the count for "PCM Words in Minor Frame." Bad practice, but that's how it is for now for reasons too laborious to be described here.
